<h1 style="text-align:right;background-color:red;"> Object oriented programming</h1>
<p>The major motivating factor in the invention of oops is to remove some of flows encounter in Procedureal language. OOPs treat data as an critical element in program development and does not allow it to flow freely around the system.
It ties data more closely to the function and protect it from the acidential modification from outside world. OOPs allow decomposition of program into number of entities called objects.</p>
<ul>
<li>Emphasis is on object rather than procedure.</li>
<li>Object may communicate with each other by sending messages.</li>
<li> Data is hidden and cannot be acessible to outside the program.</li>
<li>Program is divided into entities called objects.</li>
<li>Data structure are designed such that they are characterized the objects.</li>
<li> Follow bottom up approach.</li></ul>
<h2>Basic terminology </h2>
<ol>
<li>OBJECTS</LI>
<li>CLASSES</li>
<li>ENCAPSULATION</li>
<li>ABSTRACTION</li>
<li>INHERITANCE</li>
<li>POLYMORIPHISM</li>
<li>MESSAGE PASSING<li>
</ol>
<h2>Objects</h2>
<p> Objects are the basic runtime runtime entity in oops.They may represent a person ,place ,or anything that a programmer need to handle. Program is analysised in term of objects and mature communication between them.
When a program is executed the objects may communicate with each other by sending messages.</p>
<h2>Classes</h2>
<p> We mentioned that object contains code and data to manipulate the data. The entire set of data and code of an object made by a user defined data type with the help of class. Once a class is defined,
we can create a number of objects of it. Classes is a collection of objects. Class is a user defined data type but behave like bulid in data type.</p>
<h2>Encapsulation</h2>
<p>The wraping up of data and function into a single unit is called data encapsulation. data hiding is one of the important features of oops. Data is hidden and cannot be accessible to outside world .
only those function which are wrappes into the class can access it.</p>
<h2>Abstraction</h2>
<p>Abstraction refer to the act of representing actual information without including the background details.Classes uses the concept of abstraction and are defined as a list of abstract attributes. They encapsules all the essential information of an object.
The attribute are sometimes called as data memeber because they held the information. The function that operates on this data member are called as Methods. Since, classes uses the concept of abstraction so they are called as <span style="text-decoration:underline;">
abstact data type.</span></p>
<h2>Polymorphism</h2>
<p>It is GREEK word which means , the ability to take more than one form. Any operation may behave different behaviour in different different instances. The behaviour depends upon the type if data are to be used .
For example, if operation addition is applied on integer operands than the result will be integer value. and if the operands are strings than they concatenate and produce the third string.</p>
<h2>Message passing</h2>
<p> Objects may communicate with each other by sending messages just as the human pass message by communicate each other.</p>
